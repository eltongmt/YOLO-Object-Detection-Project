# Setting Up Your Python Environment

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment for working with a specific module.


```bash
# Navigate to the top level of this project directory
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # for unix machines
# OR
source venv\\Scripts\\activate # for windows

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install this package for easy usage the -e flag for development mode of the python package,
# which prevents user from reinstalling it after every change.
pip install -e .

# If only running scripts, without changing package, run
pip install .



# You can deactivate virtual env here by running:
deactivate

# or go on to run scripts.

```
