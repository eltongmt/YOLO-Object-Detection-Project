TODO:
- document
- make examples for how to run combined
    * I dont like the idea of doing jupyter notebooks, too much set up
        with Anaconda. Just make some python scripts.
- finish the class making
- set up model to do image classification
- get a csv from jane to figure out how to transfer the data
    into yolo format
