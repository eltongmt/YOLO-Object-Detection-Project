What we need to train the model:
- yaml file
- dataset path
- training dictionary arguments


Data manipulation pre training
- split the data into train/test OR kfold?
- generate mirrored version of images

Data manipulation post training
- smooth over data
- delete duplicates option


Presenting data options
- genereate object level data
- draw annotations on frame
- predict video from model
- stitch frames from drawn or not drawn frames
- provide blur stats for a video/frame


Blur.py could be a class

draw.py could be a class

Model could be a class that contains training, predict, and drawing functions
